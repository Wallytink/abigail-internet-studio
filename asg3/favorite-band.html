	<h1>Midtown</h1>
	<p>Midtown is a barbershop quartet from New York City. They are the 2019 Champion of the Mid-Atlantic District (MAD) of the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS). They are BHS's 2023 International Quartet Champion. Their most well known song is their cover of the Theme from Spider-Man.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tenor: Jordan Guyton (previously Nick Gordon)</li>
		<li>Lead: Anthony Fortino</li>
		<li>Baritone: KJ McAleesejergins</li>
		<li>Bass: Christian Diaz</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My dad's hobby is barbershop quartet singing, so I have been surrounded by this music all my life. I love Midtown in particular because they sing covers of more modern songs than the other quartets I am familiar with. They harmonize very well and are one of the only quartets I am familiar with that has their music available on streaming services for easy listening.</p>
