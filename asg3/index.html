	  <h3>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h3>
	  <p>This <a href="https://www.swd.org/" target="_blank">website</a> violates the clickable element guidline from the article. The text “VOCAL MAJORITY BRINGS HOME THEIR 14TH GOLD MEDAL!” in underlined, making me think it will lead to an article or something similar discussing this news, but it does not lead anywhere.</p>
      <h3>Better User Experience Through Storytelling</h3>
	  <p>Incorporating storytelling into a project can help make your goals more clear. It can also bring up questions you need to find solutions for that you may not have considered otherwise. By keeping a story in mind, you final product will likely provide a better user experience because your thought process was more streamlined than it would be without a story to follow.
      <h3>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h3>
	  <p>There are many ways to establish hierarchy, including: difference in color, size, weight, style, and placement. This <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank">website</a> has good hierarchy, which is primarily expressed through the size of its typefaces.</p>

        <h2>Creative Brief</h2>
        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
        <p>It can be difficult to accurately envision a nail polish look before painting your nails, but at that point you cannot get the polish back if it did not turn out well. This can lead to wasted nail polish and a hesitance to try new color combinations.</p>
        <h3>The Audience:</h3>
        <p>The users of this website will primarily be younger people who paint their own nails. The audience may also include people who go to salons to get their nails done. Anyone who wants to have their nail look planned out in advance can benefit from this website.</p>
        <h3>Competition:</h3>
		<ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/business/showcase/nail-color" target="_blank">Perfect - Virtual Nail Polish Try-On</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://naildesigns.com/" target="_blank">Nail Designs</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.essie.com/nail-art" target="_blank">Essie</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first site, Perfect, is very similar to what I want to accomplish, but it does not seem to include a way to share color combinations with other users. The other two websites, Nail Designs and Essie, share nail looks with users, but they do not have a way for users to make their own.</p>
        <h3>Key Message:</h3>
        <p>Painting your nails without being able to properly visualize the combination of polishes accurately can result in unsatisfactory nail looks and wasted nail polish. This website helps users avoid these things by providing a way to experiment with different color combinations digitally, compare them with reality, and share the best ones with others.</p>
        <h3>Call to Action:</h3>
        <p>Users of the website will improve the look of their nails by taking time to plan out their looks and share the best color combinations with others.</p>
        <h3>How to Measure Success:</h3>
        <p>Success for this website would be measured by how many people use the website, which could be tracked based on how many nail looks are shared.</p>
