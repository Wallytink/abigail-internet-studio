		<li>thenaildesigner.art</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When discussing these options with my friend, she did not see any glaring issues at first. This was the same person I had the 6 hats discussion with, so she had a good understanding of what my goals are for this project. She did point out a possible issue with the studio and designer options was that they may be misconstrued for something else. The studio idea could be mistaken for an actual nail salon, and the designer idea may be assumed to be some form of artist's portfolio. This left the planner option as the strongest of the three.</p>
	<p>"thenailplanner.art" is the most consistent with what the project is meant to be. This option is also the most direct and does not sound like it is trying to  be something it isn't. My project is meant to provide users with a way to plan their nail looks, and that is exactly what this domain name conveys.</p>
