	<h3>Barbara Finn</h3>

    <p>This is my mom who passed away in 2014. I would love the opportunity to get to know her better and show her the person I have become. I have been told we had similar tastes, so I think it would be interesting to have dinner together.</p>
	<h3>Taylor Swift</h3>

    <p>She is one of my favorite singers. I have yet to encounter a song of hers that I dislike, and I relate to a number of her songs. A dinner with her would allow me to tell her the impact her songs have had on me.</p>
  <h3>Alejandro Saab</h3>

    <p>He is a skilled voice actor who has worked on many shows and games I have encountered in my life. When heâ€™s not acting, he livestreams video games. He is a very entertaining individual that would add some humor to the dinner.</p>
