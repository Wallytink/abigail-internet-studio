	<h1 id="title">The Six Thinking Hats</h1>
	<div class="whitehat">
	<h2>White Hat</h2>
	<p>After describing my idea, my friend asked a few questions about whether there would be options for different skin tones as well as what the color picker would look like. There was also the question of if I would plan to have any sort of moderation for the forums.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="redhat">
	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
	<p>My friend thought the idea was "really cool," but it might be a bit too ambitious due to the sheer amount of customization options needed for absolutely anyone to be able to use it. Ideally, the nail designer would include patterns as well as nail length and shape.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="blackhat">

	<h2>Black Hat</h2>
	<p>I had not yet given enough thought to customization options beyond colors and possibly patterns. My friend pointed out that this could become quite complex due to these options. If this website were to become popular, I could also be difficult to upkeep moderation in the forums.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="yellowhat">
	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
	<p>For this section, we focused our discussion on how this website could be appealing to users. My friend completely agreed with my perspective on how difficult it can be to visualize how colors will look together. It will also be good to have a dedicated space for sharing nail ideas that could provide a sense of community. I also mentioned that it could serve as a good way to make references to show a nail solon for those who do not paint their own nails.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="greenhat">
	<h2>Green Hat</h2>
	<p>This was where my friend and I delved deeper into how far the customization could go. Skin tone as well as nail length and shape weree brought up again. This led to a discussion of the possible inclusion of hand types such as having wider palms or slender fingers as this can affect how a nail shape may look.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bluehat">
	<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
	<p>Reflecting on the conversation, we agreed that we had covered each hat and stayed on topic pretty well. Looking back on my notes, I recommended we go a bit more in depth on the red hat, then the discussion ended.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="changes">
	<h3>Changes to my Project</h3>
	<p>This discussion made me aware of how much I was missing that would give the website a wider appeal. In my head, I was imagining a color wheel next to a black and white outline of a hand. I would now like to include a skin tone selector as well as options for different nail shapes. I may also include a hexidecimal option for the colors.</p>
