	  <h2>Structured Content and Semantic HTML</h2>
	  <p>Structured content focuses on organizing a page’s data in a way that is understandable to algorithms. Semantic HTML provides more contextual information and meaning to the  information on a page. These work together to make search engines more reliable. Structured content makes it easier for an algorithm to parse information, and semantic HTML gives the structure meaning that can be better understood by humans and algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Banishing Your Inner Critic</h3>
        <p>I believe the best strategy listed for me would be to “be deceptively non-committal.” I often struggle with starting projects, but once I finally start, I am often engrossed by it until it is done. By saying that I am not really going to start working on something but instead am just preparing to work on it later, I would be much more likely to start on projects earlier.</p>
        <h3>Procrastination</h3>
        <p>Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency for someone to make a decision that yields more immediate results, even if waiting would be more beneficial. McRaney recommends outsmarting your future self by understanding that they are likely to make the same decision now-you wants to make. I struggle with procrastination, but I have been making an effort to use this strategy by telling myself that I will enjoy whatever distraction I want to choose more later because I will not feel as guilty about it.</p>
        <h3>Critical Web Design: Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>I have the power to control what information is contained within my website and how it is presented to the user. However, I cannot control how the user will react to the content nor what they may do with the information outside of my website.</p>
