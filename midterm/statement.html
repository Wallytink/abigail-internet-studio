    <h2>Design Statement</h2>

    <p>For this website, I based the colors and typeface on my own understanding of Holyoke, MA. It is a city I have visited before, but that was many years ago. I chose typefaces that I felt matched the vibe of the city. Fraunces and Khula look nice together and have that older feel that comes to mind when I think of Holyoke. I based the color palette on the flag of Holyoke, which is purple and white. That exact purple is what I used as the main accent color with a lighter version filling out the background. Additionally, I chose to add animation to my buttons to make it obvious to those visiting the website that they are meant to be clicked. When hovered over, the buttons enlarge and change color, making their interaction clear.</p>
    <p>When choosing the images to include on my website, I wanted to make sure the pictures provide their viewers with a good understanding of the places within them. The image on the home page displays the look and feel of downtown Holyoke, giving viewers an immediate understanding of the city this website is promoting. For the activities and dining pages, I chose pictures that display what someone might see if they went to each place as a way to encourage them to check each location out.</p>
