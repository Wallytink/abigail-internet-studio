	  <h2>What I Learned:</h2>
	  <h3>Critical Web Design</h3>
      <p>I did not know just how widespread the usage of HTML is. It also had not occurred to me that Linux uses the same keyboard shortcuts as Windows.</p>
	  <h3>Evolution of the Web</h3>
	  <p>Before reading this article, I knew that the Internet had evolved over time, but I did not have a clear understanding of the 3 phases. While I was vaguely aware of what the Internet looked like in the beginning, I did not realize that it only stored and displayed information at the start and took many years to gain user interaction.</p>
	  <h3>The Wax and Wane of the Web</h3>
	  <p>It is important to consider how the Internet might continue to evolve when designing a website. Something that is convenient now may not retain its functionality in the future.</p>

      <h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	  <p>For my semester project, I will likely make some sort of wiki site based around a topic I'm interested in. This will likely be some sort of video game, book, or movie series. I would include information about locations, characters, and, if I am focusing on a video game, guides for progressing through different points of the game. Alternatively, I may try to create a team builder/character guide for Genshin Impact. This would include information on what different characters do as well as how they can work together in different combinations. I am hesitant about this idea because it may be a bit too ambitious considering my lack of website design experience before this course.</p>
