	  <h2>What I Learned:</h2>
	  <h3>Critical Web Design</h3>
      <p>I did not know just how widespread the usage of HTML is. It also had not occurred to me that Linux uses the same keyboard shortcuts as Windows.</p>
	  <h3>Evolution of the Web</h3>
	  <p>Before reading this article, I knew that the Internet had evolved over time, but I did not have a clear understanding of the 3 phases. While I was vaguely aware of what the Internet looked like in the beginning, I did not realize that it only stored and displayed information at the start and took many years to gain user interaction.</p>
	  <h3>The Wax and Wane of the Web</h3>
	  <p>It is important to consider how the Internet might continue to evolve when designing a website. Something that is convenient now may not retain its functionality in the future.</p>

      <h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	  <p>A hobby of mine is painting my nails, but it can be difficult to visualize how they will look before I put the nail polish on my nails. I will often take a picture of my nails and add color to the picture using my phone to test out color combinations. To make this easier, I would create a website that allows the user to plan out the colors they will use before painting their nails. You could individually set each nail to a different color to envision how the final combination will look without having to waste your polish. Additionally, people could upload combinations for others to see and possibly add pictures of the final look for comparison.</p>
